# GoM-Raffler
Raffle program made for streamers and marathoners

The following will tell you how to configure Config.ini.

Ticket
A ticket is a chance to win, the value beside the ticket is how much money it is per ticket. If the value for ticket is 1 then someone who donated would have 5 chances to win. If the value was 5 then the donor would have 1 chance to win.

Clear winner
After a winner is selected the window will display the personâ€™s name who won, and announce they are the winner. The value beside clear winner is the amount of seconds it will stay up on the screen.

Included you will find a font, a ticker wav and a fanfare wav. You can place your own fonts and sound effects in the folder change the names of the files that are included to something else. And name the files accordingly. Ticker wav must be named 
ticker.wav, fanfare wave must be named fanfare.wav, and font must be named font.tff.

There is a file named "exclusion list.txt", you can update this with names manually or let the program add winners to the list. 
If the name is on the list they will not be selected as a winner.

The raffle.txt is where you put the names of the Donors and the amount they have donated. It is very important that you put the names in correctly. It should look as follows:

Name1

Name2

Name3

Name4

5

10

10

10

The first line should be the first name on the donor list. At the end of the list should be a line with nothing on it, not even 
a space. If there is a character on the separator line it will break the program. The line after the separator line should be the first donation amount. The first donation amount is the amount the first donor had donated. In the above example, Name1 has donated 5 dollars.
